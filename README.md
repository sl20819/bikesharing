# NYC Bikesharing Analysis
## Overview of the statistical analysis:
 The primary purpose of the analysis is to understand the Citi bike schematics of the working model in New York city. The various data points will be analysed to understand nuances of peak periods of renting and gender analysis. This can be used to provide additional information to make an educated decision on how this would play out in a different markeT outside of NYC, in Des Moines, Iowa.
## Results:
1. We start by looking at the most popular summer month of August to see when the most popular hours of bike rental are. Evenings between 5 and 6 pm are the most popular hours followed by 8am . This makes sense and the traffic pattern suggest that it could be the daily commuters using bikes are a mode of transpotatio
2. We drilled down one level to see how long the bike check outs are on an average and where the top starting and ending points are. The most popular ones are in the downtown region further strenghening the idea of the daily commuters or even tourists who might be using the bike rentals to get a look and feel of the city. 
3. Gender. How is the gender distribution in the citi bike rentals and the analysis showed a very skewed usage by males users compared to the female counterparts. 
4. Another view of the data is to understand the trips by the hour and by the weekday. This cut of the data also confirms ( similar to popular hour visual) that 8AM and 5 -6PM are themost popular times 
5. To understand how much of this usage can be attributed to repeat customer, slicing the data by gender and further by weekday shows that the subscribers are more likely to use the bike rental services and within that the makes use it more often than females. Thursdays and Fridays are busiest times in the week.

## Summary:
A subscription model for the citi bike rental focusing on commuters during early morning hours and peak rush hour traffic times ( 5-6pm) should be the focal point of the business model. Depending on Des Moines tourist traffic, providing early bird specials ( 8am) or evening special programs will likely fetch more users.
